Over the weekend Microsoft's <a href="http://luis.ai">Language Understanding Service (LUIS)</a> which is part of the Cognitive Services and the Cortana Intelligence Suite was updated to support the Dutch (Nederlands) language! Great news for anyone who needs to support Dutch in their applications and be able to understand Dutch. We are the 12th language on the list :)
