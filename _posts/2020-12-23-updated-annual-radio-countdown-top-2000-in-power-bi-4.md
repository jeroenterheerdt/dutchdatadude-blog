<p>Here we are again - trying to continue the tradition of updating my Power BI analysis of the Dutch <a href="https://top2000.nl">Radio 2's Top 2000</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year however, the report was fully redesigned by my friend <a href="http://data-marc.com/">Marc Lelijveld</a> after he complained it was really outdated. He was right, of course. So I (t)asked him to update it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is the result. I must say, it looks really cool! Thanks Marc, great job!</p>
