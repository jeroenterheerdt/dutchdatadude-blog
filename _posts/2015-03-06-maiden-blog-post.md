Hi all,

Today I joined my colleague Jeroen in this Blogsite about Data.
Where Jeroen is the expert in BI, Big Data &amp; Data warehousing I tend to focus on applications, databases, development &amp; integration. And off course with a main focus on the Cloud with Azure.

I will try to keep you posted on all new developments with my personal view on it combined with my 25 years+ experience and day to day work at my customers.
So keep posted for myÂ new posts!

Greets, Harry
