In an <a href="http://www.dutchdatadude.com/using-power-bi-to-visualize-your-music-collection/">earlier post I used Power BI (specifically Power Query, Power View and Power Pivot) to get insight into my music collection</a>. In this post I have a conversation with my music collection using Power BI Q&amp;A.

Q&amp;A enables you to "talk" to your datasets and ask questions in natural language. Q&amp;A gets the data, proposes a visualization and displays it. You can then change the question, get immediate feedback. This invites the user to do data exploration.

What I did to make this work is this: I uploaded the Excel sheet to SharePoint and enabled it for Power BI. Then I enabled the same sheet for Q&amp;A. Next step was to use Q&amp;A and ask questions.

The question I started with was: "number of albums by release date". Q&amp;A responds like this:

As you can see, it selected my Excel sheet and chose a line graph to display the number of albums by year. What is interesting is the spike to the left. It turns out this is a data quality issue: a lot of dates have been reported as being 31/12/1899 when there was no date in the tags in the first place.

Let's say I would like to focus more on recent data, such as albums since 1960. I refined my question to "number of albums by release date after 1960", which gives me this result:

Then I decided to look at one decade: "number of albums per artist where decade is 1980 â€“ 1989". This is the result I got:

As you can see in this decade Queen is on the top. Let's dive a bit deeper into in which decades Queen released albums that I have in my collection: "number of albums by decade where artist is Queen". This is the result:

As you can see I have got quite a few Queen albums spread over multiple decades. Now let's see if Queen is indeed as popular in my collection as it might look. I decided not to look at albums but at number of tracks. I refined my question to: "top artist by number of tracks". This is the result.

Interestingly Queen is only in 10<sup>th</sup> place here (even after the choir which my mom is part of <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">J</span>). Based on the number of tracks Herman Brood is the most popular artist in my collection.

This got my wondering about the actual duration of the music (track length). Finally, I changed the question to: "top artist by total length". This gave me the following result:

<img alt="" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/012414_1036_UsingPowerB6.png" />

When looking at the total track length of all songs Queen is back at place two and my all-time favorite band is on top (Supertramp).

Hope you enjoyed the tour of my music collection using Q&amp;A. Looking forward to feedback and your examples!
