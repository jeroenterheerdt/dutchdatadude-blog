Recently a Power Query update was released (see <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2015/03/05/3-updates-excel-power-query/">http://blogs.office.com/2015/03/05/3-updates-excel-power-query/</a>). Mayor updates: performance on load, Dynamics CRM Online connector and new transformations, most notably advanced date/time calculations. Personally I enjoy the CRM Online connector, but I am most fond of the 'Age' transformation; it makes it very easy to do the typical 'number of days since this order was entered' type of calculations, since it compares the date in the column with today.

The update to Power Query is available here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39379&amp;WT.mc_id=Blog_PBI_Announce_DI">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39379&amp;WT.mc_id=Blog_PBI_Announce_DI</a>

Enjoy!
