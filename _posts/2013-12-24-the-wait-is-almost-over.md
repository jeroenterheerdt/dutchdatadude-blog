It's almost Christmas!

Well, uh, that's not actually why I wrote this post. I noticed a note on the Power BI blog that says: "In a few days we will enable the ability to explore your own data with Q&amp;A. You can add your own models to Q&amp;A and begin to explore them with natural language query." (See full post here: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powerbi/archive/2013/12/13/one-step-closer-to-simplifying-data-analysis-and-visualization-new-features-added-to-power-bi-for-office-365-and-power-query-add-in-for-excel-preview.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powerbi/archive/2013/12/13/one-step-closer-to-simplifying-data-analysis-and-visualization-new-features-added-to-power-bi-for-office-365-and-power-query-add-in-for-excel-preview.aspx</a>)

Read that again! This means that you can upload your own Power BI workbooks and use Q&amp;A to have a conversation with your data. How cool is that! Minority report anyone?
