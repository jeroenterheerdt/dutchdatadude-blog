Anxiously you have waited for this day. The day you could finally get your hands on the latest version of the best database platform available. Today is that day. SQL Server 2017 is available and it runs on Windows, Linux and Docker. Find more info here:Â <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017</a>. What changed? So many things it is hard to mention them all. Have a look at the Ignite sessions to get a feel for what happened.
