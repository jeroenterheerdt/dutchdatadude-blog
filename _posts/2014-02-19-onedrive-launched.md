Today we (re)launched <del>SkyDrive</del> OneDrive, our solution for storing, sharing and editing documents in the cloud. OneDrive is cross platform (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Windows) and syncs files automatically. It even enables you to edit Office files right there in the browser. Even better: it's free!
