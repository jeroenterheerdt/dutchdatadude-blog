With the big news of the Power BI and Cortana integration I could not wait until next week to publish this short video of me demo-ing this cool technology! In the video I ask Cortana a couple of questions on stats from my a part of my blog that I record using Google Analytics. How cool is that? This shows the unique ability of Microsoft to integrate a BI technology such as Power BI with Windows to make it very easy for users to get the information they need when they need it where they need it. Do you speak BI? Great stuff don't you think?
