Another great resource for learning about Power BI is the course on EDX: <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/analyzing-visualizing-data-power-bi-microsoft-dat207x-2">Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI</a>. Granted, has been around for a while, but I forgot blogging about it; maybe it is a bit easier to find now.

Enjoy the new skills you will learn with this!
